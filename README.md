### ðŸŒŸ Days 1-5
Days 1 to 5 were made in `Python`. You can use your favorite Python interpreter to run it:
```shell
cd Day1
python3 day1.py
```

### ðŸŒŸ Days 6-10
Days 6 to 10 were made in `C#`. You can compile and run the code with the _.NET SDK_:
```shell
cd Day5
dotnet run
```

### ðŸŒŸ Days 11-15
I'm planning to do days 11 to 15 in `C++`. I use a script `run.sh` to compile and run the program. It works as follows:
```shell
cd Day11
# Create bin folder
mkdir -p bin
# Compiltion with Apple clang (need C++11 for lambdas)
clang++ day11.cpp -std=c++11 -o bin/day11
# Make executable
chmod +x ./bin/day11
# Run
./bin/day11
```
_Feel free to use any C++ compiler. The code above should work on any Mac with XCode or clang installed._
